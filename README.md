### License
It's MIT, have at it!

### Note
This is not an official IOTA app, nor do I know if it's 100% secure to use. But with this at least you'll know where the KeyGen is coming from (not connected to some website you need to turn the internet off for).

### Built with 
Electron and Bootstrap :)
